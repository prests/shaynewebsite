        <p>Hi, my name is Shayne Preston. I am a senior finishing my degree as a Computer and Systems Engineer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I came to Rensselaer in 2015 as a soloist, initially just for Computer Science, but I found myself engaged group oriented and team building activities, as well as learn more about how computers work beyond just the application layer. I have recently discovered a passion for network security and cryptography, a passion that I continue to deepen and develop today. In this day and age, people's security on the internet has become less secure, and this loss of security doesn't necessarily have to do with exploits in hardware or software. Social engineers can get inside a strangers life without ever needing to know how to code. This poses a major problem for todayâ€™s growing cyber-connected world, a problem that I hope to tackle in my pursuit of enhanced cybersecurity along with my flexibility of functioning in group or individual environments.</p>
        <p>Beyond just my love of coding, I have a strong passion for music. My music career began in middle school, where I first learned how to play the saxophone.  I later moved past the saxophone, stepping into the world of computer generated music, linking into my passion for technology in general. And finally, most recently, I came to RPI and I started pouring my excess creative energy into DJing. I love how Electronic Dance Music can be cut, sampled, and played differently than the song was originally intended. I have started to also mix in rap, rock 'n' roll, and even classical music to set moods and create exciting new genres. My Spotify is playing almost constantly, but is also growing constantly, with new music and songs being added that I think will be fun to mix. After a while, I got to DJ some of my fraternity's parties, and I even got paid to play for a few others. Overall, electronic music is a passion that I found long ago, but continue to pursue, helping me stretch my creative mind in unique ways that only mixing all different genres of music can do.</p>
        <p>In the winter I love skiing. You can see me in the picture to the left representing my fraternity's rush shirt while skiing next to RPI's EMPAC building. I have been skiing ever since I was a kid and love skiing anything and anywhere that I can.</p>
        <p>Back home I have a beagle named Jessie, who is my favorite animal. She recently has turned ten and I will include some pictures so you all can fall in love with her as well.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy my website. I made it from scratch using Angular 5 and Sass. I plan to add more visuals and animations. I want to show off what I am capable of, coding wise, as well as help this website grow with me. Although I have a passion for cyber security, I pretty much love all Software Engineering. Group projects are fun and exciting to me and the feeling of working and finishing a product and seeing it put into action is exhilarating.</p>
