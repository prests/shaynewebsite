        <p>Hi, my name is Shayne Preston. I am a senior finishing up my degree as a Computer and Systems Engineer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I came to Rensselaer in 2015 initially as a just Computer Science, but I wanted to do more group orriented and team building and learn more about how computers work beyond just the application layer. I have recently grown a passion for network security and cryptography. In this day and age people's security over the internet has become less secure and it doesn't even have to do with exploits in hardware or software. Social engineering can get someone inside a strangers life without even knowing how to code.</p>
        <p>Outside of all things code I have a strong passion for music. In middle school I learned how to play the saxophone which I dropped to learn more about computers, but once I came to RPI I started to get into DJing. I loved how Electronic Dance Music could be cut, sampled, and played differently than the song was originally intended. I started to also mix in rap, rock 'n' roll, and even classical music to set moods. My Spotify is playing almost constantly, finding new music and songs I might want to mix in. After a while I got to DJ some of my fraternity's parties and got paid to play for a few others!</p>
        <p>In the winter I love skiing. You can see me in the picture on the left repping my fraternity's rush shirt while skiing next to RPI's EMPAC building. I have been skiing since I was a kid and love skiing anywhere and anything that I can.</p>
        <p>Back home I have a beagle named Jessie, who is my favorite animal. She recently has turned ten and I will include some pictures so you all can fall in love with her as well.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy my website. I made it from scratch using Angular 5 and Sass. I plan to add more visuals and animations because I want this website to grow with me. Although I have a passion for cyber secruity, I pretty much love all Software Engineering. Group projects are cool and exciting to me and the feeling of working and finishing a product is exhilerating.</p>
